# Company Task Management System

Welcome to the Company Task Management System! This system allows efficient management of users and task assignments within our organization. The backend is built with Flask, a Python web framework, providing robust and scalable API endpoints. On the frontend, we utilize React with TypeScript for a modern and type-safe user interface.

## Features

- **User Management**: Manage users including creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of user details.
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to users with due dates, descriptions, and statuses (e.g., in progress, completed).
- **Department Management**: Organize users into departments for streamlined collaboration.
- **Dashboard**: Provides insights into task completion rates, departmental performance, and pending tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, SQLAlchemy (ORM for database operations), Flask-RESTful (API development)
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Axios (HTTP client for making API requests)
- **Database**: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
